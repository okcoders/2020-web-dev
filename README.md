# Week 3 Homework
1. Watch videos #2, 3, 4 & 6 from [this free CSS Flexbox video course](https://flexbox.io). I also highly recommend [this CSS tricks Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). 
2. Go back to the 3 sites you recreated from examples last week. Try to use the new CSS styling and layout skills we practiced in class to make at least 1 section in each site much closer to the original. If you get stuck, reach out in Slack!

# What we'll cover next week
Can you believe we're already approaching our fourth and final class for the HTML & CSS module? Crazy. There's still some great topics to cover including:
* Fixed and Absolute positioning
* Applying a CSS framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to build grids and components faster
* And if we have time â€” how you can host your site for free using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so everyone can find it
